# How I Set Up My Cybersecurity Portfolio

As a cybersecurity analyst, I wanted a professional yet straightforward way to highlight my skills, experience, and ongoing projects. A public portfolio felt like the perfect solution, not just for potential employers but also to track and share my growth in this field.

I started by choosing GitHub Pages to host my portfolio since it was simple, free, and offered a version control that would allow for future changes to the content and appearance of my site in a way which I found to be aesthetically pleasing. My portfolio was simple to get up and running. I opened a GitHub repository with a simple index.html file, and incorporated PicoCSS to get a professional feel without weighing me down with complexity.

In my bio I showcase my expertise in endpoint detection and response (EDR), incident handling, and real-time threat analysis. I also included links to my GitHub and LinkedIn, making it easy for visitors to find more information regarding the specifics of my projects or professional experiences.

Moving forward, I'm excited to expand my portfolio with detailed project breakdowns, blog posts, and insights from my journey into scripting and automation. If you're starting out in security, I'd highly recommend creating your own portfolio as soon as possible. Start small, keep it personal, and make it authentic. I believe it's one of the best ways to learn, grow, and showcase your passion professionally.
