    <h1>Vlad Ignatovskiy</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Vlad Ignatovskiy, a cybersecurity analyst specializing in endpoint detection and response (EDR), incident response, and real-time threat analysis. I'm currently an EDR Analyst at Liquid Networx, where I proactively monitor enterprise networks across numerous locations. My expertise includes troubleshooting complex network infrastructure issues, mentoring teams on best practices, and reviewing EDR alerts to determine whether further investigation is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, I began learning Python and Java scripting to leverage automation and data analysis in strengthening cybersecurity operations. My recent projects include developing custom PowerShell scripts and configuring Azure Sentinel to visualize global attack data for situational awareness and reporting.
